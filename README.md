There is a message from the picture number 2.

Topics of individual Labs:

- Lab1 - hiding the data by replacing the most significant bit of the red color
- Lab2 - hiding the text from the command line by substituting the least significant bits. Hiding data in the form of a spiral starting in the center of the image.
- Lab3 - hiding the text from the command line by replacing the least significant bits of the wav sound file. Pseudo-random data hiding using a hash function.
- Lab4 - analysis of a photo with a hidden message by extracting layers of the least significant bits of the image
- Lab5 - comparison of color histogram and LSB values for images with and without a hidden message
- Lab6 - hiding the message using Hamming code (7,4) coding and the LSB algorithm
